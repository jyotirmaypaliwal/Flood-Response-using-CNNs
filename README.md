# Flood-Detection-using-CNNs

### Here I have come up with a **flood relief** solution with the help of modern day technologies such as **artificial intelligence** and **deep learning**.

## Architecture

### Our image classification task is divided into 3 sub tasks which are - 

#### 1) Gathering images - This task involves gathering images through various sources. In our project we collected images primarily from a European flood images
####                       dataset and secondary from social media images. 
####                     - Our data consisted of images categorized into 2 classes which are - a) containing humans
####                                                                                           b) not containing humans
####                     - Our total data size was of around 2000 images among which 700 images contained humans.
